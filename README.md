# DOM-in-MicroEco

Dissolved organic matter (DOM), which is widely distributed in complex natural environments, plays a crucial role in global biogeochemical processes. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) is routinely applied to characterize the molecular composition of DOM. [Formularity](https://pnnl-comp-mass-spec.github.io/Formularity/) is one of many programs that have been developed for assigning molecular formulae in complex mass spectra.

Here, [FtmsAnalysis](https://github.com/KaiMa-endeavour/DOM-in-MicroEco/releases/tag/FtmsAnalysis) was developed to integrate molecular information from multiple samples. Please click [here](https://github.com/KaiMa-endeavour/DOM-in-MicroEco/wiki) for more details.
